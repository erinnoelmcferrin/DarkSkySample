This may be done by the Facility or through a partnership with a local group.\\r\\nLight Fixture Compliance: The Facility shall review its lighting inventory at least annually for consistency with the LMP and shall update the Inventory documentation as needed.\\r\\nOutreach: The Facility shall evaluate its outreach program at least annually and make changes as needed.\\r\\n4.2 Annual report\\r\\nThe Facility is required to submit an Annual Report on sky quality measurements, light fixture compliance, and outreach and educational activities for the year, including any changes to the lighting or sky quality measurements (see Section 4.1). \\r\\nFailure to submit the Annual Report in a timely manner will result in the suspension of the Facility’s DarkSky Approved Lodging certification. If the Facility submits the report within 90 days, the certification will be reinstated. After 90 days, it will be assumed that the Facility wishes to withdraw from the Program.\\r\\nThe Facility should maintain a current point of contact and notify DarkSky of any changes within 30 days.\\r\\nShould the Facility change ownership, the new owner should notify DarkSky within 30 days.\\r\\nAdditional information on the specific requirements for the Annual Report can be found in Appendix C.\\r\\n4.3 Recertification\\r\\nTo ensure that the Program meets the highest standards of professionalism and integrity and that a DarkSky Approved Lodging remains exemplary in its protection and restoration of nocturnal lightscapes, DarkSky will recertify each Facility every five years.\\r\\nAs part of the recertification process, the DarkSky Approved Lodging (hereafter, “Lodging”) should update its Habitat Identification Report (HIR) and its Lightscape Management Plan (LMP) as necessary to be consistent with the current Program criteria. It is expected that any changes to the outdoor lighting on the Lodging property will be consistent with the updated LMP.\\r\\nRecertification requires the submission of the current Annual Report (refer to Section 4.2 and Appendix C), confirming that the Lodging continues to meet the minimum standards and requirements set out in the Program guidelines.  A recertification fee will be estimated to cover an additional site visit to confirm site conditions at year five.  (see Section 3.1.D)\\r\\nIt is expected that the recommendations for lighting will evolve over time, given new information on the effects of light and as new products become available. As a result, the DarkSky Approved guidelines may also change. As updated guidelines are issued, the Lodging will have the option of continuing under the prior guidelines for an additional five years.\\r\\nDarkSky Approved Lodgings are encouraged to indicate how they plan to bring any non-compliant light fixtures into compliance with any new program requirements within 10 years. For example, an applicant certified under the 2022 guidelines would be due for recertification in 2027. If new guidelines were released in 2025, the Lodging would have the option to continue under the 2022 guidelines for an additional five years. Alternatively, they could start operating under the 2025 guidelines and be certified as such when they meet the new requirements for compliance.\\r\\n4.4 Decertification\\r\\nShould a DarkSky Approved Lodging fail to comply with the requirements in this document, DarkSky reserves the right to suspend its DarkSky Approved certification until such a time that issues of noncompliance have been resolved to DarkSky’s satisfaction. In the event that these matters cannot be resolved in a timely manner, DarkSky shall terminate the facility’s certification and remove it from the list of certified sites.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.5 Withdrawing from the program\\r\\nAn approved facility may withdraw from the program at any time for any reason, subject to a 30-day written notice. Any fees paid are nonrefundable.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.6 Investigation and due process\\r\\nAny allegation of impropriety concerning any of the elements of participation in the Program outlined in this document will be subject to DarkSky investigation and potential remedial action, including temporary suspension or permanent revocation of the designation. DarkSky International staff shall perform due diligence in gathering facts concerning such allegations they deem credible and will prepare a report of their findings for consideration by the Executive Director.
